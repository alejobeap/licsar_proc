## Introduction
LiCSAR is a software package created to generate InSAR products for the NERC funded LiCS "Looking inside Continents from Space" project to COMET (http://comet.nerc.ac.uk/). The main purpose of the software is to have a set of scripts/programs that using GAMMA software (http://www.gamma-rs.ch/), as core processing kernel, will deliver differential interferograms into a database for further processing. This version is only meant to process Sentinel-1 SLC IW images for more detailed information about this dataset please visit https://scihub.copernicus.eu/ and/or http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1

LiCSAR is release "as is". LiCSAR is a research tool, hence it is in constant development, and it is made publicly available under GPL v3 license. Any potential user should use at their own risk.
